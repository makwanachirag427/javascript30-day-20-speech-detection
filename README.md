Today's project focuses on implementing native speech recognition using the browser's built-in Speech Recognition API. We will create a simple web application that allows users to speak into their device's microphone and see their speech converted to text in real-time on the screen.

### Concepts Covered:
- Utilizing the Speech Recognition API
- Capturing and processing user's speech
- Updating the DOM dynamically based on speech input

### Project Overview:
1. Set up the HTML structure for the application.
2. Access the device's microphone using the Speech Recognition API.
3. Implement event handlers to capture and process speech input.
4. Update the DOM to display the speech input in real-time.
